		<method id="affinitydiagramming" category="formative,solutions,designprocess" title="Design Method: Affinity Diagram">
			<p>Affinity diagramming is a method used to organize and categorize information gathered during research or brainstorming sessions. It is a technique that helps to group ideas, thoughts, or data into related categories and identify patterns and connections.  The process of affinity diagramming begins by collecting a large amount of information, such as notes from interviews, observations, or brainstorming sessions.</p><p>This information is then written on sticky notes or cards and placed on a wall or board. Participants then work together to group the notes into related categories by moving the notes around and discussing the connections between them.  Once the notes are grouped into categories, the categories are given labels or names that summarize the main theme or idea of the group. These labels are then organized into a hierarchy, with higher-level categories representing broader themes and lower-level categories representing more specific ideas.</p><p>The output of affinity diagramming is a visual representation of the information that is easy to understand and navigate. It helps to identify patterns and connections in the data, and can be used to inform the design of products or services, generate ideas for research, or guide decision-making.  Affinity diagramming is a useful tool for bringing structure to large amounts of unstructured data, and it allows the group to work collaboratively and identify patterns and connections that might not be apparent otherwise. It's a powerful method to use in a team setting as it allows the team to have a shared understanding of the research or project.</p>Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_diagram" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>

The data is analyzed repeatedly to identify emerging patterns, and these patterns are used to generate a theoretical framework that explains the phenomenon being studied.</p><p>The coding process typically includes the following steps:</p><ol><li>Open coding: This is the initial stage of coding, where the data is read and broken down into small chunks of information, called "codes." Codes are assigned to specific segments of the data, based on the content and meaning.</li><li>Axial coding: This stage involves grouping the codes into broader categories, based on similarities and relationships.</li><li>Selective coding: This stage involves identifying the core category, which is the central concept that connects all the other categories.</li><li>Memo writing: Memos are written to document the researcher's thoughts and observations about the data and the emerging categories.</li><li>Constant comparison: This is an ongoing process where new data is compared to the existing codes and categories to identify similarities and differences, and to refine the coding scheme as needed.</li></ol><p>These coding steps are iterative and cyclical, meaning that the researcher will repeatedly go back and forth between the different coding steps to ensure that the codes, categories, and theoretical framework accurately reflect the data.</p><p>The goal of coding is to identify patterns and relationships in the data and to generate a theoretical framework that explains the phenomenon being studied. Coding is an essential step in Grounded Theory, as it allows researchers to make sense of the data and to generate a comprehensive theoretical framework.</p><p>Grounded Theory is a valuable method in HCI research as it allows researchers to generate theory from data, rather than testing a preconceived theory. It also allows researchers to identify patterns and relationships that might not be obvious from the data alone. It's also useful in identifying new opportunities and unanticipated use cases. However, it's important to keep in mind that Grounded Theory is a time-consuming method and it requires a significant amount of data to generate a comprehensive theoretical framework.</p>Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grounded_theory" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>

		<method id="personas" category="formative,analytical,datadriven" title="Data-driven Analysis: Personas">
			<p>Personas, or fictional characters based on user research and feedback, have revolutionized Human-Computer Interaction and created a personalized experience for users. In today's world, technology plays a prevalent role in everyday life, and it is increasingly important to ensure that users have an efficient and enjoyable experience when interacting with such technology. This essay will discuss the concept of personas and their role in human-computer interaction, highlighting how their implementation has allowed users to have a tailored experience.</p><p>Personas are especially useful for uncovering the nuances of the people’s characteristics and requirements. Through user research and personas, designers can create products and services that are tailored to the needs, while also taking into consideration their physical, cognitive, and emotional capacities.</p><p>Data-Driven Personas (DDP) are an increasingly popular human-computer interaction (HCI) technique for understanding user behavior. According to Jansen, Salminen, Jung, and Guan (2021), DDPs “are generated from user data such as demographics, interests, behavior, and preferences” and are used to “make more informed product decisions”. As the authors note, DDPs are a powerful tool for understanding user behavior and providing tailored experiences that meet user needs. Furthermore, they can be used alongside other HCI techniques such as user research and interviews to further understand user behavior. By combining information gathered through user research and interviews with insights gained through DDPs, designers and developers can create user experiences that are tailored to the specific needs of their users. Additionally, DDPs can be used to identify and address areas of user dissatisfaction that may not be picked up by other HCI techniques. In conclusion, DDPs are an effective tool for understanding user behavior and should be used alongside other HCI techniques to create user experiences that are tailored to the specific needs of the users.</p>

			<p>Fitts's law (often cited as Fitts' law) is a predictive model of human movement primarily used in human–computer interaction and ergonomics. Over the years, different variations of the original law have been used in various HCI projects to further study the behavior of the user and design better user experiences. In this essay, I will discuss the various aspects of Fitts Law and explain how it has been utilized in the field of HCI such as for 2D or 3D.<p></p>The law predicts that the time required to rapidly move to a target area is a function of the ratio between the distance to the target and the width of the target. For a model-driven analysis a device's constants (a and b) in his formula [1] must be known.<p></p>Fitts's law is used to model the act of pointing, either by physically touching an object with a hand or finger, or virtually, by pointing to an object on a computer monitor using a pointing device. Furthermore, it has been used to investigate how users interact with touchscreens, such as those found in mobile phones and tablet computers. As such, Fitts law is an important research and design tool that can be used to improve the user experience of HCI.</p> Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27s_law" target='_blank'>Wikipedia</a>

CMN stands for Card, Moran and Newell and it takes the KLM as its basic and adds subgoals and selection rules. This model can predict operator sequence as well as execution time. A CMN-GOMS model can be represented in program form, making it amenable to analysis as well as execution. CMN-GOMS has been used to model word processors and CAD systems for ergonomic design(see CAD).

GOMS is meant to model an individual user, working in isolation, with no unexpected interruptions, similar to a Cognitive Psychology experiment. This level of analysis is sometimes referred to as microcognition to distinguish it from macrocognition, which refers to real world cognition. SGOMS is meant to expand the applicability of GOMS to the macro cognitive level of analysis. To do this, SGOMS adds a high level control structure to GOMS, called the planning unit.

			In human–computer interaction, the keystroke-level model (KLM) predicts how long it will take an expert user to accomplish a routine task without errors using an interactive computer system. It was proposed by Stuart K. Card, Thomas P. Moran and Allen Newell in 1980 in the Communications of the ACM and published in their book The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction in 1983, which is considered as a classic in the HCI field. The foundations were laid in 1974, when Card and Moran joined the Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) and created a group named Applied Information-Processing Psychology Project (AIP) with Newell as a consultant aiming to create an applied psychology of human-computer interaction. The keystroke-level model is still relevant today, which is shown by the recent research about mobile phones and touchscreens (see Adaptions) Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke-level_model" target='_blank'>Wikipedia</a>

		<method id="cognitivewalkthrough" category="formative,empirical,problems,experts" title="Usability Inspection by Experts: Cognitive walkthrough">
			The cognitive walkthrough method is a usability inspection method used to identify usability issues in interactive systems, focusing on how easy it is for new users to accomplish tasks with the system. A cognitive walkthrough is task-specific, whereas heuristic evaluation takes a holistic view to catch problems not caught by this and other usability inspection methods. The method is rooted in the notion that users typically prefer to learn a system by using it to accomplish tasks, rather than, for example, studying a manual. The method is prized for its ability to generate results quickly with low cost, especially when compared to usability testing, as well as the ability to apply the method early in the design phases before coding even begins (which happens less often with usability testing).

		<method id="eyetracking" category="empirical,quantitative,objective,attention" title="Quantitative Objective Attention: Eye Tracking Fixations">
			Eye tracking is the process of measuring either the point of gaze (where one is looking) or the motion of an eye relative to the head. An eye tracker is a device for measuring eye positions and eye movement. Eye trackers are used in research on the visual system, in psychology, in psycholinguistics, marketing, as an input device for human-computer interaction, and in product design. Eye movements are typically divided into <strong>fixations</strong> and <strong>saccades</strong> - when the eye gaze pauses in a certain position, and when it moves to another position, respectively. The resulting series of fixations and saccades is called a <strong>scanpath</strong>. Smooth pursuit describes the eye following a moving object. Fixational eye movements include microsaccades: small, involuntary saccades that occur during attempted fixation. Most information from the eye is made available during a fixation or smooth pursuit, but not during a saccade.

		<method id="systematicreviewKitchenham" category="literature,systematic" title="A Systematic Literature Review: Kitchenham Procedure">
			Appropriate for software engineering researchers and a mean of evaluating and interpreting all available research relevant to a particular research question, topic area, or phenomenon of interest. Aim is to present a fair evaluation of a research topic by using a trustworthy, rigorous, and auditable methodology. The guideline presented was derived from three existing guidelines used by medical researchers. The guideline has been adapted to reflect the specific problems of software engineering research. The guideline covers three phases of a systematic review: (1) planning the review, (2) conducting the review and (3) reporting the review. It does not consider the impact of question type on the review procedures, nor does it specify in detail mechanisms needed to undertake meta-analysis.

		<method id="scopingreviewPRISMASc" category="literature,scoping" title="A Scoping Review: The PRISMA-Sc Method">
			PRISMA-SC is a PRISMA extension for scoping reviews. The checklist contains 20 essential reporting items and 2 optional items to include when completing a scoping review. Scoping reviews serve to synthesize evidence and assess the scope of literature on a topic. Among other objectives, scoping reviews help determine whether a systematic review of the literature is warranted.
